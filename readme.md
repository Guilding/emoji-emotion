for more information, such as tags, descriptions, and names regarding
these faces.

## Support

See [support.md][support].

## Data

The contained emoji are the faces and cats defined by [Unicode][].
The polarity was hand classified (by one person) based on the names of
these emoji (sometimes synonyms) and their [AFINN-111][] values.
Special care was given to **not** classify based on the images (as
different vendors use different pictograms), but only on words and how
they are used.

Note that some emoji receive arguably confusing polarities, such as
`stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes` (`0`), due to being used for both
positive and negative emotions.
